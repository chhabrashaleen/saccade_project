Clone the repo into your folder, the files should be able to run on python versions >= 3.7
Come to the present working directory where the src/ folder is there

run:
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)

NOTE: for all the injectors, exchanges and strategy sockets, I have hard coded the Host (in class) and Port (in main()) so that it becomes easy.

Once you are in the correct directory and python path is also set in the terminal --

To run the basic_hit_stat.py: requires 5 different terminal sessions

1. launch first exchange: session1
python src/bin/infra/exchanges/exchangeSCH.py
2. launch second exchange: session2
python src/bin/infra/exchanges/exchangeSCS.py
3. launch the strategy: session3
python src/bin/markets/execution/basic_hit_strat.py
4. launch first eventInjector: session4
python src/bin/infra/events/injectorSCH.py
5. launch second eventInjector: session5
python src/bin/infra/events/injectorSCS.py 

The strategy and both the exchanges start printing the logs. I have shared the sample logs for all three components, 2 exchanges and one strategy log files.


To run the exercise.py: requires 3 different terminal sessions

1. launch the exercise file TickListener: session1
python src/bin/markets/execution/exercise.py
2. launch first eventInjector: session2
python src/bin/infra/events/injectorSCH.py
3. launch second eventInjector: session3
python src/bin/infra/events/injectorSCS.py

After connecting to both the injectors, the injectors will start dispatching the ticks and the TickListener will listen, process into OrderBook and then prints it
