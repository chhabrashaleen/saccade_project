This is a project to showcase my expertise and understanding of trading systems/frameworks in a high frequency trading domain.

The code structure and flow is completely similar to what it would have been in C++ or Java.
I have coded it in a similar way to C++, have not used the third party python libraries and extensively used the concepts of OOPs - classes, objects, function delegates, inheritance, etc.
I have also tried to make sure of private and public variables at most places in all of my modules.

Although the test signal "HiLo" which I designed, is giving profit in this strategy, I would have designed a more sophisticated signal, but it is not the objective of this project.
More generalization of the infrastructure to further support multiple function delegates, multiple components of all kinds could have also been implemented.
